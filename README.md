# README for ICDAR 2024 Paper Classification

## Overview

This project classifies ICDAR 2024 conference papers using natural language processing techniques. For each paper it extracts its title and authors, preprocesses the metadata, and categorizes documents into predefined classes based on it, by implementing a zero-shot classifier from HuggingFace.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - transformers
  - PyMuPDF

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AntonisGantzos/ICDAR-Paper-Classification.git
   cd ICDAR-Paper-Classification
   
## Usage
- For data configutation, execute the code and it will pull and extract the raw version of the zip file containing the pdfs automatically from github.
- Open the Jupyter Notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.
- Install all libraries mentioned in the **Requirements** section
- Execute the cells sequentially to run the analysis.
- The classification results and visualizations will be displayed after execution.

## Notes
- Use a GPU for better performance with deep learning models.
- Adjust hyperparameters for optimal results based on your dataset.
